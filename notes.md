## Why animate?
1. Guidance and clarification

2. Style and branding

## Fundamentals
### Duration
How long an ITERATION of an animation takes to compplete
- A loader could be infinite, but its iteration is 1-2 sec.

### Delay
How long it takes before an animation starts

### Timing functions
The easing of an animation (cubic bezier: imagine a line-graph with time on X and progression on Y)

- Recommendation for cubic bezier: keep the Y values on 0 and 1 like so: cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.5, 1)

### CSS Variables
Also known as CSS custom properties, because they are inherited and cascade

### What to animate
üëç transform and opacity (GPU, handles this well)
‚úÖ color and background (CPU, handles this fine)
‚ùå height, width, left, right, margin, padding etc (CPU, avoid animating layout)

### Ideas for Sl library
Setup
- Use CSS variables instead of SASS variables, since they can be used in JS
- useRef to change element styles using CSS variables as string:  "--main-color"
- enum to match the colors/CSS variables: "enum COLORS { main: "--main-color" }
