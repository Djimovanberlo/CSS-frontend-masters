# Week 1

## Why animate?

1. Guidance and clarification

2. Style and branding

## Fundamentals

### Duration

How long an ITERATION of an animation takes to compplete

- A loader could be infinite, but its iteration is 1-2 sec.

### Delay

How long it takes before an animation starts

### Timing functions

The easing of an animation (cubic bezier: imagine a line-graph with time on X and progression on Y)

- Recommendation for cubic bezier: keep the Y values on 0 and 1 like so: cubic-bezier(0.5, 0, 0.5, 1)

### CSS Variables

Also known as CSS custom properties, because they are inherited and cascade

### What to animate

üëç transform and opacity (GPU)
‚úÖ color and background (GPU)
‚ùå height, width, left, right, margin, padding etc (CPU, expensive, try to avoid)

# Week 2

## Transitions

- Transistion between two states - in some libraries called 'tweens'.
- Use transition when you want to leave the 'animation' between two states to CSS.
- Lots of built in CSS states: :hover, :active, :target, :focus etc

### Ideas for Sl library

Setup

- Use CSS variables instead of SASS variables, since they can be used in JS
- useRef to change element styles using CSS variables as string: "--main-color"
- enum to match the colors/CSS variables: "enum COLORS { main: "--main-color" }
